One of the most leading death causes in the world is brain tumor. Tumor Detection is
one of the most difficult tasks in medical image processing. in fact, the manual classification
with human assisted support can be improper prediction and diagnosis shown by medical
evidence. The detection task is too difficult to perform because there is a lot of diversity in the
images as brain tumors come in different shapes and textures.
 Recently, deep learning techniques showed promising results towards improving
accuracy of detection and classification r brain tumor from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
In this project, we propose a deep learning model for the classification of brain tumors from
MRI images using convolutional neural network (CNN) based on transfer learning. The
implemented system explores a few CNN architectures, image pre-processing and transfer
learning model named Mobil Net to achieve the better performance and accuracy.
